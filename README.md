# Distributed-constraint-satisfaction
 Example of algorithms used to solve distributed constraint problems

## Asyncronous-backtracking-algorithm
Uses hyper-resolution and asyncronous backtracking to send Nogood constraints to agents based on priority order.
Example solves a 4x4 N-Queen problem.

## Doman filtering algorithm
Uses Arc-consistency to reduce domains into smaller ones.
