# Distributed-constraint-satisfaction
 Example of algorithms used to solve multiagent distributed constraint problems.

## Asyncronous-backtracking-algorithm
Uses hyper-resolution and asyncronous backtracking to send Nogood constraints to agents based on priority order.
Example solves a 4 queen problem recursively as agents' messaging is simulated by function invocation.

## Doman filtering algorithm
Uses Arc-consistency to reduce agent domains into smaller ones.
